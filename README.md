# Lightbulb Lab

## Description
With the given starter code and assets, make the light bulb switch functional.

## Skills in Development / How It Went
Workied on using State correctly for conditional rendering. At first I tried to make it harder than it needed to be. Still getting comfortable with all of those ternary statements. Made a ton of syntax mistakes at first, and I'm still not great at formatting as I go ... thank goodness for Prettier.



### Objective
Make a switch that turns the light bulb off and the room dark (when clicked)

#### HINTS: 
- the "dark" class can be added to animate the divs with class of "switch" and "switch-button" 
- the light bulbs (off and on) are available in the assets folder inside src
- the background and color properties will need to change in response to clicking the switch

### EXTRA:
- add a sound effect when the light switch is clicked (an audio file is provided in the assets folder)
- add a brightness control feature using an input with type of "range" (look up the filter CSS property and its brightness function)
